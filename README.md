# Little Big Adventure 2 - Engine source code

Little Big Adventure 2 (aka Twinsen's Odyssey) is the sequel of Little Big Adventure (aka Relentless : Twinsen's Adventure) in 1997.

We are releasing this code with preservation in mind, as this piece of work was exceptional for the time and we believe it can be a valuable source of education.

The engine uses Assembly code and was originally compiled with non-open source libraries which have been excluded from the project.
